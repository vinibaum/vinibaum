### Hi there! 🧑🏻‍

My name is Vinícius Baum from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as FullStack Developer since 2012. Specialist in .Net developing, but currently studying React to enter AND DOMINATE the mobile world.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Ewave do Brasil at Tribunal de Justiça do Mato Grosso, as a web developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Business Intelligence using Qlik Sense AND programming in React through Alura courses.

In my free time I like to play soccer (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and play drums (🥁) and, of course, at weekends have a beer (🍺) (or a dozen!).

Would you like to find me?
